    Death Diaries</h1>
    <p class="home-text">A blog where failure is the main event.</p>
    <p class="home-text-two">Losing isn't the end—it's where the best stories begin. Death Diaries is a blog dedicated to the hilarious,
    heartbreaking, and unforgettable defeats we face in games. Whether you were crushed by a boss fight, betrayed by a party
    member, or watched your favorite character fall to permadeath—we want the tale.</p>

<h2 class="what-title">What Is Death Diaries?</h2>
<div class="what-wrapper">
    <p class="what-text">We're not here for speedruns, flawless combos, or platinum trophies. We're here for the forgotten saves, the last-minute
    mistakes, the boss fights you almost won—and the tears (or laughter) that followed. Death Diaries is a curated blog that
    captures the most human moments in gaming—when control slips, when tension snaps, when the screen fades to black. These
    are not just failures; they are memories.</p>
    <p class="what-text what-text-two">Founded by lifelong gamers who were tired of seeing "Game Over" treated as a dead end, this blog embraces the artistry
    of defeat. Each post is a eulogy, a confession, or a comedic breakdown of a moment that didn’t go as planned—but
    couldn’t have been scripted better. Some entries will make you laugh. Some might make you think. Others will hurt just
    enough to remind you why you loved that character, or why you’ll never trust that NPC again.</p>
    <p class="what-text what-text-three">We celebrate the messy, emotional, and often hilarious reality of playing games—not to be perfect, but to be surprised,
    challenged, and ultimately moved. If you've ever stared at a loading screen in silence after losing someone or something
    in a game, you already understand what this is.
    Welcome to the place where your worst gaming moments become your best stories.
